# powerTCR: modeling the clone size distribution of the TCR repertoire

This is an R package for fitting the discrete gamma-GPD spliced threshold model to a distribution of clone sizes. The package contains tools needed to perform all of the analyses found in __my paper__. 

## Installation

Install this package from Bioconductor by typing in R
```{r}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("powerTCR")
```

or by downloading the [source package](powerTCR_0.1.0.tar.gz).

## Getting going
